# IOT-Based-Bot
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller connected via the arduino app to create a simple chatbot. It uses a **chatbot API** (like OpenAI or Dialogflow) to process user input and display the response on the ESP32. The system combines IoT and AI for real-time interactive communication.
