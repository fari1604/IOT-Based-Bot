# IOT-Based-Bot
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller connected via the arduino app to create a simple chatbot. It uses a **chatbot API** (like OpenAI or Dialogflow) to process user input and display the response on the ESP32. The system combines IoT and AI for real-time interactive communication.



This project connects an ESP32 microcontroller with a chatbot API to display intelligent responses.  
It uses Arduino IDE for coding and integrates IoT with AI for real-time interaction.

## How to Run
1. Connect ESP32 to your computer.
2. Upload the code using Arduino IDE.
3. Enter your API key and Wi-Fi details.
4. View chatbot responses on the serial monitor or display.

## Requirements
- ESP32 Board
- Arduino IDE
- Chatbot API (OpenAI or Dialogflow)
- OLED
